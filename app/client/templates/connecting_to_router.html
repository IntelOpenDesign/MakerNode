                Sorry, something didn't work. Please try these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure you are connected to your home network</li>
                <li>Go to {{s.url_root}}</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If that still doesn't work, we're very sorry. You might try contacting carlos.montesinos@intel.com for support.
