testing out events. what can i catch?
mousedown works on computer and phone
taphold usually does taphold followed by tap - how to handle this?
what should be like taphold on computer - double click?

maybe i should monkey wrench a couple of events to be my own thing just for this app, ex.
(taphold + optionally tap) or (doubleclick) --> my_long_press_event
mousedown --> my_click_event

conclusion so far:
nice helper function to listen to taphold and tap makes it so that the first tap following a taphold does not trigger the tap event handler (see app.js)
